            <p>“Your time is limited, don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma, which is living the result of other people’s thinking.

Everything else is secondary.” – Steve Jobs</p>
            <p>Life is a gift. Never forget to enjoy and bask in every moment you are in.</p>
